# Ongoing Project - Nothing is Final!

# What does the AutoExploiting-Pi Do?

The AutoExploiting Pi is a Semi-Open Source(1) Project funded and headed by Lister Unlimited Cybersecurity Solutions, LLC. https://www.listerunlimited.com/

It has a (a) hardware component costing more than $700 USD (b) software component containing soon-to-be-proprietary code(2) and (c) contains a rudimentary Artificial Intelligence, life breathed in via various scripting and programming environments.

The idea is to grant wireless pentesters a device that can perform their penetration testing tasks as easy as "Plugging in the Pi and waiting outside the target's house for less than a minute".

The current prototype model boasts...

  1. Absurd amounts of hitting power and range, allegedly 16.9 miles with more than 24 dB of gain
  2. Completely automated post-exploitation (via Routersploit Framework)
  3. Completely automated wireless attacks targeting WEP, WPA2-PSK, and WPA2-MGT/ENT/RADIUS
  4. Absolute discreetness to not arouse suspicion (the Raspberry Pi 3 is a $35 microcomputer, hardly the stereotyped tool of some evil Hollywood 'hacker')
  5. SCREAMIN' hacking speed using threading and subprocess modules and field-tested logic statements
  6. Various perks due to our choice of hardware components, including a Ubiquiti Networks M2 Bullet, complete with a software Spectrum Analyzer, Hotspot Repeater Capabilities and Audio-Assisted Targeting https://www.ubnt.com/airmax/bulletm/, and a specialty-model pair of wireless amplifiers provided by Hak5, LLC https://hakshop.com/products/long-range-wifi-kit. Totaling more than 58 dbM of transmit power, and 5 Watts of Output Power EIRP.
  
For a approximate price of just under $1,000 USD.

Coming soon in the Last Quarter of 2018.

# Here is a Marketing Blurb

The Lister Unlimited Wright Project is the largest collaborative endeavor in the company's history, meant to bring to the niche consumer a specialty wireless penetration testing tool with no parallel.

The Wright Project is named after Marcus Wright, the antihero of the movie Terminator Salvation, and arguably the predecessor to the successful T-800 line of Skynet Terminator Units that resulted in the near-extinction of humanity post nuclear holocaust. Much like Marcus Wright, Lister Unlimited is determined to have you, as the attacker, breach your target of choice and to conduct your mission completely unseen and unsuspected.

Our current alpha test model, referred to inner circles of LULLC as the "Lister Helix", is a all-in-one Wireless Attack Array composed of:

1. Three Pentester-Approved Wireless Adapters, one internal omnidirectional, and two external directionals
2. Dual RF Powered-Amplifiers tuned to the 2.4Ghz band, generating 5 Watts of Output Power EIRP, 58 dBm of amplified transmit-power
3. One additional RF Powered-Amplifier with Audio-Assist Targeting, Persistent-Reauthentication, and Spectrum Analysis Capabilities for the "perfect shot"
4. Dual Directional-Antennas of both a Parabolic-Type (maximum range) and Panel-Type (best directional coverage) with a maximum of 24 dB of gain
5. A heavily modified Raspberry Pi "brain" with AI guiding the processes of deauthentication attacks and post-exploiting a compromised router

Contributors to the project involve the parties of Hak5 LLC, Ubiquiti Networks, TrendNet, ALFA Networks, and the Raspberry Pi Foundation to name a few.

The "Helix device" is designed to engage penetration testing targets beyond the visual range perceptible by the naked eye, and it boasts a maximum attack range of 16.9 miles unobstructed, being able to project a reliable wireless signal through five houses uphill, and can engage targets half a mile away across water. It is managed by a fully autonomous and aggressive Artificial Intelligence of LULLC proprietary design, known as ABOMINABLE INTELLIGENCE. When powered on, the AI will run separate DAEMONIZED processes, allowing it to exploit the networks it knows the password to and attack fresh wireless networks to capture the encrypted password, at the same time. ABOMINABLE INTELLIGENCE will routinely upload it's newly captured handshakes to a remote password cracking rig of your discretion to crack the credentials, allowing you to maintain the momentum of your indiscriminate wardriving and war-kitting spree. It is truly, a self-aware "War Machine".

This device requires 4.9A of current at 5V to fully utilize it's capabilities. That is nearly half the maximum output of a standard wall outlet socket. But is designed to safely drawn the power from your car with no additional strain on your stock alternator.

# Footnotes

  (1) The repository will remain Open-Source for now. Upon the final release of Version ONE, the official commercially viable production model of the AutoExploiting Pi, there will be no updates to this repository. **However we will leave the repo up at that date for the Open-Source Community to play with and build something else creative**
  (2) Once AutoExploit Pi's Version ONE is released, the code for AutoExploit Pi will fork into two unique and distinct repositories.       a. **Version ONE** shall remain OPEN-SOURCE with the code in cleartext. 
    b. **Version ONE+ (any version above 1.0)** will become proprietary code of Lister Unlimited Cybersecurity Solutions, LLC. and will be sold and distributed as a compiled binary software suite, packaged and preinstalled with the hardware components at the time sale.
